PART-A

1. Simulate a three nodes point to point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

2. Simulate a four node point to point network with links connected as follows: n0,n2, n1,n2 and n2 n3. Apply TCP agents between n0 n3 and UDP agents between n1 n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP.

3. Simulate an Ethernet lan using n nodes (6-10)change the error rate and data rate and compare the throughput.

4. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and determine collision across different nodes.

5. Simulate simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.

6. Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

PART-B

1. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16bits).

2. Write a program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for transmission.

3. Write a program for congestion control using Leaky bucket algorithm.

4. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client server program to make client sending the file name and the server to send back the contents the requested file if present.
